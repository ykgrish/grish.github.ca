This is my attempt at making a different portfolio / services / about me website .

i am using following things in this project , and this may change towards the end of projet

**Primary Languages:**

HTML5 - For the website structure and content
CSS3 - For all styling, animations, and responsive design
Python 3.11 - For running the HTTP server


**Technology Stack:
**

Pure vanilla HTML and CSS (no JavaScript frameworks)
Python's built-in HTTP server for local development
Google Fonts (Playfair Display and IBM Plex Mono)

The project follows a minimalist approach with no complex build processes or dependencies - just clean HTML and CSS served by Python's simple HTTP server. This makes it lightweight, fast-loading, and easy to maintain.
